# My Streamlit COVID-19 App

## The Beginnings:
Utilizing the data from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), I have created an interactive display of this data. 

Written in Python, this app uses Streamlit and Pandas to vizualize the data, and show trends over time.

Check back soon to see updates!
